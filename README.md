# WMGaugeView - custom

* Modification of WMGaugeView that separate config from the drawning code. Allowing shared config for gauges drawn on different platforms (ie. AppleWatch)
* Theme support
* Draw gauges on AppleWatch
* Support up the three needles on a gauge
* Ability to draw the actually value on the gauge
* Allow full 360 degree gauges (drawLastNumber=NO)
  

There is code in here specific to my app. I will remove and generalize in the future...
